# Solutions to Programming Challenges in C

In this project I:
* Demonstrate the use of pointers and pointer arithmetic
* Demonstrate my basic yet comprehensive understanding of C
* Use the fundamental components of a C program
* Adhere to modern coding standards for the C language
* Use input and output streams

To compile:
```
gcc -ansi -c coursework.c -o coursework.o
gcc coursework.o -o coursework

I completed this project whilst undertaking the ECM2433 module at the University of Exeter - full PDF specification can be found in *specification.pdf*

The header file *msString.h* was provided to me as part of the project and is not my own work; *msString.c* is my work
